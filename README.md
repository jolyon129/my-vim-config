## My Vim Config

Back up my vim config file here.
BTW, I also put my tmux config file here.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo and rename the directory .vim
2. Put .vim into ~ directory
3. Remeber to make soft links of .vimrc and .viminfo 
  `ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc ln -s ~/.vim/.viminfo ~/.viminfo`
4. Meanwhile, make a soft like of .tmux.conf to `~`. `ln -s ~/.vim/.tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf`

## In case I forget

I'm using vundle(kind of obviously).

The vim backup is turned on and all of those `.*~` files are sroted in `~/tmp/`.

The plugin I'm using:
* surround
* commentary
